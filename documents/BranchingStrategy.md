# Branching Strategy

Feature Branching with pull requests

- Main branch for development
- branch for each feature / unit being worked on
- pull requests with CI/CD?
    - One person assigned to each pull request, perferrably someone who is not as knowledgable on that feature so that everyone is learning.
    - The person most specialized on that thing is assigned to review.
